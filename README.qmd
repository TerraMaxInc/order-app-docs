title: "Ordering App System Docs"
format: gfm
---

This repository contains all documentation for the Order App project, which consists of two main parts:

- **ordering-app**: A React PWA for end users, hosted in Azure Static Web Apps
- **hubspot-service**: An Azure Functions backend that communicates with HubSpot

This app allows end users to create and edit Deals in HubSpot via the ordering-app's interface, which is more streamlined and intuitive for TerraMax business needs, and to automate emailing Work Orders to production as part of the entry process.
