Check Status in GitHub Actions\n\nIn the GitHub account:\n\nopen the ordering-app repo\ngo to the Actions tab\nSelect All workflows from the Actions sidebar (it may already be selected)\n\nIn the All workflows section, you will see a list of past workflows, and the date they were attempted. You may need to refresh to see the one you just triggered. You may see a yellow circle to indicate that it’s in progress; it will automatically change to show when it’s complete.\nIf it turns red to indicate failure, click on the entry to view the error details. Sometimes they are transient and you can try again; try rebuilding the app, re-committing, and redeploying."
