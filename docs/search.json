This is fine; you can’t make a token for the org account anyway. It’s a matter of permissions for your account, not of using the org accont directly.\nSelect tokens (classic) from Personal access tokens, then click the little Generate new token dropdown thing and select Generate new token (classic). Again. You might find some resources, like chatGPT when it’s in the wrong mood, will tell you that the fine-grained tokens are better.

Once a Deal is successfully written to HubSpot it is assigned an object id, but that only happens at the end of the first save. It is potentially possible that this HubSpot-based id might fail to be passed back to the client app, and the user might attempt to save again and create a duplticate. To head off this danger, the idempotency id is generated in the client app as soon as a user starts a new order. It is saved in the hubspot_transactions log so that the hubspot_service can check the id of an incoming deal against the log and ensure that it’s not a duplicate. This id is also saved to a custom property in HubSpot as part of the Deal’s data, so it can be used for reference in future edits to thet Deal.\nThe transaction id exists not to prevent the creation of duplicate Deals, but duplicate actions done for a Deal. Most especially, it’s intended to prevent sending duplicate emails to Dave when the Deal is closed/won. This value is also generated in the client-app, not on starting a new deal but at key points in processing, so that when a user makes sufficient changes to the Deal they will get a new transaction id and be able to save again.\nThe dealID is the object id assigned to a Deal by HubSpot when first saved to their database. This is the most important value, the one that most fundamentally defines the record, but it cannot be accessed or predicted until after the first successful save."

Every row will have one cell in each column, and every record will have one value for each property–though in some cases that value might be blank or 0.\nWhen creating or editing a property in HubSpot, the interface describes the types by their input method rather than by the nature of the data itself. Under the hood, all data is stored as a String, and the property type tells HubSpot how to translate it for display. This is most important to know when dealing with it directly in its raw form in the HubSpot Service, but it’s useful to understand when using HubSpot, too.\n\n\n\nHubSpot Data Type\nRaw Data Type\nFunctional Data Type\nLimitations and Notes\n\n\n\n\nSingle-line text\nraw string\ntext\n65,536 characters, does not allow line breaks.\n\n\nMulti-line text\nraw string\ntext\n65,536 characters, allows line breaks but they may not work in all tools.\n\n\nRich text\nstring of html\nrich text\n64 KB, Allows text with stylization, color, fonts and images.

Formated numbers can have 20 digits, and unformatted 38.\n\n\nDate picker\nstring of date in Unix Time format\nstring of date in ISO 8601 format\nHubSpot’s internal database uses Unix, as do some older versions of the API. The v3 API used by the HubSpot Service uses ISO 8601 format, with the time set to midnight/0, and the Unix is entirely invisible.\n\n\nDate and time picker\nstring of date and time in Unix Time format\nstring of date in ISO 8601 format\nHubSpot’s internal database uses Unix, as do some older versions of the API. The v3 API used by the HubSpot Service uses ISO 8601 format, and the Unix is entirely invisible.\n\n\nSingle checkbox\nstring of boolean values\nBoolean\n“true” or “false”.\n\n\nMultiple checkboxes\nstring of ; separated enumeration values\nset of Enumeration values\nOne or many of several pre-defined options, stores values and displays labels. This comes closest to a functional array within HubSpot Object properties, but is limited by the fact that all values must be pre-defined and equally available to all records, and can’t be filtered by other properties.\n\n\nRadio select\nstring of an enumeration value\nsingle Enumeration value\nOne of several pre-defined options, stores value and displays label. Same function as dropdown.\n\n\nDropdown select\nstring of an enumeration value\nsingle Enumeration value\nOne of several pre-defined options, stores value and displays label.

Stores and displays the calculated result, the equation itself is in the property’s metadata and not individual records.\n\n\nRollup\nstring of result\nvalue aggregated from associations\nCalculated from properties of associated records, cannot be used in all tools. Stores and displays the calculated result, the equation itself is in the property’s metadata and not individual records.\n\n\nProperty sync\ncopied string\nsnapshot of reference\nStores a copy of the value from a property on another record at the time of syncing. Not dynamically updated when the referenced value changes.\n\n\nFile\nstring of file url\nlink\nActual file stored elsewhere and the property holds a link to the file location.\n\n\nHubSpot user\nstring of user id\nOwner record\nUses the id to get readable user name directly from the Owner Object Record.\n\n\n\nProperties cannot be true arrays; one property field cannot contain more than one value except in the case of Multiple Checkboxes, but that type is extremely limited.\nIf a Contact has a property like Phone Number, it can only contain one phone number. To add a second phone number as a property, you’d need to create a second property, Phone Number 2, which would be an entirely separate property and not searchable together with the first Phone Number property.\nIf you instead tried to use Multiple Checkboxes for Phone Number, then you would have to enter all possible phone number values into the property type in advance, and require users to select the desired phone numbers from the entire list of all phone numbers for all Contacts or Companies.\nThe best way to give a Record multiple values of the same type is with Associations."

You give this outlet a name, an icon, a description, and you define what HubSpot resources it exposes to anything that plugs into it, and HubSpot automatically generates an API key for it.
