The **HubSpot Service** is the intermediary that connects the user-facing [Ordering App](../ordering-app/ordering-app.html) to the [HubSpot Accout](../../hubspot/hubspot-overview.qmd). Because a client application isn't sufficiently secure to hold the `hubspot api token`, a backend service was needed to manage authentication and API requests securely.

This is a Node.js app written in Typescript, and hosted in Azure Functions.  It makes heavy use of the environmental variables for security and configurability.
