Logging in to the Azure Portal should take you to the home page.  There you should see a row of icons of Azure Services, like *Static Web Apps* and *Azure Functions*, and below that a list of current resources.

Most of the icons in the row of Services will take you to a page that displays all current resources of the service type.  You can also create new recources, either within the page dedicated to the specific type, or by clicking on the `Create a resource` plus sign button in the home screen.  

Other services of note in the top row are:

- **Microsoft Entra**: manages identity across all accounts within the TerraMax organization.  The `App Registration` section is important for managing security and communication between the Ordering App and HubSpot Service.

- **Cost Management**: lets you view the current and predicted costs of various resources, set spending limits, and set warnings for when those limits are reached. See [how to check costs](../../../how-to/check-costs.html)

Below the row of services, you should see a list of current resouces.
