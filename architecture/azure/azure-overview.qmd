Azure is a cloud platform owned by Microsoft that offers a variety of online resources.  TerraMax has a single Azure account, which uses the same @tenant-id as the TerraMax *Microsoft 365* account (which supplies resources like Word, Excel and SharePoint).  This means that both the Azure and Microsoft 365 accounts are part of the same *organization*, share access to user identities and security settings, and are both managed through **Microsoft Entra**.

This project uses Azure to host several components in a secure and centralized way, allowing them to share the same security infrastructure.  They can be viewed and managed through the **Azure Portal**.

## Azure Portal {#portal}
Logging in to the Azure Portal should take you to the home page.  There you should see a row of icons of Azure Services, like *Static Web Apps* and *Azure Functions*, and below that a list of current resources.  

![Azure Portal Home Screen](../../images/azure-portal-home.jpg)

Most of the icons in the row of Services will take you to a page that displays all current resources of the service type.  You can also create new recources, either within the page dedicated to the specific type, or by clicking on the `Create a resource` plus sign button in the home screen.  

Other services of note in the top row are:

- **Microsoft Entra**: manages identity across all accounts within the TerraMax organization.  The `App Registration` section is important for managing security and communication between the Ordering App and HubSpot Service.

- **Cost Management**: lets you view the current and predicted costs of various resources, set spending limits, and set warnings for when those limits are reached. See [how to check costs](../../how-to/check-costs.html)

Below the row of services, you should see a list of current resouces.

## Project-Specific Resources

Core components of this project include:

- **Ordering App** ([`terramax-ordering-app`](ordering-app/ordering-app.html)): a user-facing web app that users can directly interact with to submit and manage Deals in HubSpot.  
    - Hosted in **Azure Static Web Apps**
    - Written in **React + Typescript**
    - Uses **Microsoft Entra ID authentication** via MSAL, allowing only TerraMax users to log in

- **HubSpot Service** (`terramax-hubspot-service`): a backend API that connects the Ordering App to both an internal product database, and HubSpot's records of customers and sales.
    - Hosted in **Azure Functions**
    - Written in **Typescript**
    - Uses **Microsoft Entra ID** to validate incoming requests and restrict access to approved applications

- **TerraMax Data** (`terramax-data`): a SQL database that holds the masterlist of product information, and a log of transactions that have passed through the server app.
    - Hosted in **Azure SQL database**
    - Accessed only through the server app, not directly by the client

Other relevant resources:

- `terramax-hubspot-service-app-insights`
    - Application Insights instance connected to the `terramax-hubspot-service`Function App, which logs data about the app's use.
- `terramax-db-server`
    - Logical SQL Server that contains the `terramax-data` database.  Azure requires a server to exist, even if it only hosts a single DB.
- `TestResourceGroup`
    - The main Resource Group that contains all parts of the project in Azure.  The name comes from its origin during the beginning phase of the project, but to rename and restructure would require recreating resources.
- `ASP-TestResourceGroup-b475`
    - The App Service Plan associated with the Function App `terramax-hubspot-service`.  It defines the underlying compute environment, and was auto-generated (and named) by Azure.
- `testresourcegroup8e0c`
    - The storage account automatically created to support the Function App `terramax-hubspot-service`, used for things like 
- `ordering-app_group`
    - An organizational group that Azure auto-generated, not structurally important.  It overlaps imperfectly with the `TestResourceGroup`
