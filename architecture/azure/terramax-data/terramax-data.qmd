This is an [Azure SQL Database](azure-sql.qmd) that stores data not suited to [HubSpot](../../hubspot/hubspot-overview.qmd)'s structural limitation'.  It wasn't possible within HubSpot's **Products** object to incorporate our three pricing tiers without awkward work-arounds, and so an external database was needed.  Once in place, other uses have emerged, like logging transactions and storing Product history.

HubSpot contains Product data that *mirrors* this SQL database data, in flattened form, for the sake of reporting within HubSpot.  It can be updated programmatically to synch with any changes made to the SQL database, using the `updateHSProducts` function in the HubSpot Service.

The [HubSpot Service](../hubspot-service/hubspot-service.html) interfaces with this database when it needs to store or retrieve information.  The front end user never interacts with it directly, and syncing HubSpot Products with the Products data in the database is done via an Azure Function.  There are some tasks that require direct SQL queries to the database however, like [adding](../../../how-to/add-product.html) or [editing](../../../how-to/edit-product.html) products, or checking history.
