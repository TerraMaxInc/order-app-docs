title: Product Data Structure

The structure of *Product* data in the TerraMax SQL Database is more complex than the flattened *Product* object in [HubSpot](../../hubspot/hubspot-overview.qmd).  It involves six tables, four of which simply contain single field sets of data to populate tho main tables, and two of which assemble the data into more complex objects.

This database differentiates between the `Sku`: the item a customer purchases with a specific size and price, and the `Product`: the actual material inside the item.  One Product may come in multiple sizes, and thus have mutliple skus.  The `Applications`, `Crops`, and `Types` tables are associated with the `Product` table, and the `Sizes` table is associated with the `Skus` table.
