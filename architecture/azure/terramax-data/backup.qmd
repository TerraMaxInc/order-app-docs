Azure SQL database maintains restore points of data, but retrieving it requires creating a duplicate database, which is a nuisance.  This may be useful to have in some worst-case scenario, but for day-to-day safety and convenience, the *TerraMax Data SQL Database* has internal tables to track change history for the `Products` and `Skus` tables.

These history tables can be used both for restoring pervious data in the event a SQL query goes wrong and damages data, and to simply view the state of the data in the past.  The tables both mirror the data structure of the working tables `Products` and `Skus` with added fields.

- **Both Products_history and Skus_history contain:**

| Column | Data Type | Purpose |
|:-------|:----------|:--------|
| `id` | PK, int, not null | Auto-generated id for the row. |
| `backup_event_id` | uniqueidentifier, not null | a GUID generated at the time of the backup, shared by all rows inserted at the time of that specific backup. |
| `backup_timestamp` | int, not null | Date-time of the backup event. |

- `Products_history` contains all other fields in `Products` as well, with `Products.id` translated to `Products_history.product_id`.  The combination of `backup_event_id` and `product_id` should also be unique within the tables.

-`Skus_history` containsa ll other fields in `Skus` using the same column names.  The combination of `backup_event_id` and `sku` should also be unique within the tables.


## Actions

These history tables can be managed via *stored procedures*:
- `Backup_Products_And_Skus`: to be run before making changes to the `Products` or `Skus` tables, saves the current state of data to these history tables
