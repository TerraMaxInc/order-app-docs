**Azure Static Web Apps** is a hosting service for front-end apps, usually built in frameworks like React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/Javascipt.  Unlike general services like Azure App Service, it is designed specifically to serve only static files, and optionally connect to backend APIs like Azure Functions.

This is well suited to the **Ordering App** component of the project.  The front-end app itself is a **Progressive Web App**, bundled as static files (HTML, Javascript, CSS) that can run entirely in the browser and doesn't need a traditional server.  For retrieving or procesing data, the app calls the **HubSpot Service**.
