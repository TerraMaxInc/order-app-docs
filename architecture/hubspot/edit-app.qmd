Nearly all edits you might want to make will be from the Auth section. 

In the Basic Info section you can change the app's name, give it a logo/icon, and write a description.  These things will appear in the *Private Apps* page to help you distinguish this app from others, but are otherwise cosmetic and don't affect the functioning.  You can change them without upsetting the way the app integrates.

## Edit Scopes
Editing scopes is more consequential.  If you delete any scopes, the app may cease to function.
