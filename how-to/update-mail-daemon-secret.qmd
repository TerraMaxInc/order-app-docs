title: Update Mail Daemon Client Secret
format: html
---

The HubSpot Service's ability to send emails from the `tech@terramax.com` email requires extra permissions that had to be given by Coordinated.  Technically, these permissions are granted to the app *registration*, and so for the actual app to use it, it needs to connect to them via the client secret.  

The client secret is like an access token; the registration generates and provides it, and then the app holds onto it as an environmental variable so it can prove it has a right to the permissions listed in the registration.  Client Secrets come with expiration dates, and need to be refreshed.

When the HubSpot Service client secret gets close to expiry, you will recieve warning emails about it.  If it expires, thhen the app and the backend service it provides to connect the [Ordering App](../architecture/azure/ordering-app/ordering-app.html) and [Product Manager App](../architecture/azure/)
