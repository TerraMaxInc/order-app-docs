This project involves a lot of tokens that the various components use to access each other.  Some of these expire and need to be manually refreshed.

## PDF-Service
The PDF Service uses a PAT (Personal Access Token) from GitHub to access the app's @docker-container @docker-image from the GitHub Container Registry.  Because we use the free tier that doesn't run continuously, and so the app has to cold start, Azure *does* need consistent, up-to-date access to fetch the image from the registry every time.  The PAT, however, expires by default after only a month. 

To update this token, see [Update PDF-Service Token](../how-to/update-pdf-service-token.html)

## HubSpot Service
### 1. HubSpot Token
The backend [HubSpot Service](../architecture/azure/hubspot-service/hubspot-service.html) app uses a token from HubSpot to connect directly to data within our [HubSpot](../architecture/hubspot/hubspot-overview.html) account.  This token does not expire, and does not need ongoing maintenance.  

### 2. Mail Daemon Client Secret
The HubSpot Service also uses a Client Secret to gain permission to send emails on its own behalf from the `tech@terramax.com` email.   This "secret" expires every 6 months, and without an active none of the client apps can send emails.  

To update this token, se [Update Mail Daemon Secret](../how-to/update-mail-daemon-secret.html)
